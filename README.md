# SnakeGameJS

In an interview I was asked to create a Snake game in Javascript. 
45 minutes made a bit of a dent in the task, but I wanted to give it more of a go and practice my vanilla Javascript.
Since this was an interview question, I won't reveal the company or the exact specs of the game, for confidentiality purposes.
The first commit made was the result of 2 hours, timeboxed to see what I could get done. 
The game's not in a ready state at this juncture, so I may or may not continue to extend this.
